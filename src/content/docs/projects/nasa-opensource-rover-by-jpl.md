 ### JPL Open Source Rover

The JPL Open Source Rover is an open source, build it yourself, scaled down version of the 6 wheel rover design that JPL uses to explore the surface of Mars. The Open Source Rover is designed entirely out of consumer off the shelf (COTS) parts. This project is intended to be a teaching and learning experience for those who want to get involved in mechanical engineering, software, electronics, robotics but is also an excellent research platform for rugged terrain. No prior skills or knowledge is required.
<br>

### Features
This rover is designed to function similarly to the 6 wheel rover designs on Mars and employs a few of the major driving mechanics that the Mars rovers use to traverse rocky surfaces:
<br>
Rocker-Bogie: The Rocker-Bogie suspension system allows all 6 wheels to continually be in contact with the ground while climbing over obstacles.
<br>
Differential Pivot: Allows weight to be mechanically offloaded from one side of the rover to the other while climbing.
<br>
6-Wheel Ackerman Steering: Driving and steering/turning mechanism that governs where the wheels point and how fast each of them will move.
