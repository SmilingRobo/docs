 ### Humanoid Shadowing and Imitation from Humans

HumanPlus is an open-source humanoid robot developed by researchers at Stanford University. It is capable of learning and accurately reproducing complex sequences of human movements, including in real-time.

The robot is based on Unitree's commercial humanoid H1 robot, but with a completely different software platform and some other third-party components. HumanPlus is equipped with arms made by Inspire-Robots and wrists made by another supplier, and stands at about 175 cm tall.<br>

One of the key features of HumanPlus is that it only needs 40 hours of video footage of people performing a task to learn how to repeat those actions on its own. Additionally, thanks to its built-in camera, the robot can follow the movements of people in real-time and immediately imitate them.<br>

HumanPlus is open-source, which means that anyone can modify its structure and functionality. The developers have published a GitHub repository with detailed documentation, allowing engineers and enthusiasts to build a similar model themselves.

The total cost of the components used to create HumanPlus is publicly available, with rough calculations estimating it at $107,945. Considering the robot's wide range of motion, this figure seems quite competitive compared to alternatives on the market today.

The introduction of HumanPlus coincided with the announcement by Elon Musk that more than 1,000 Optimus humanoid robots will be working in Tesla factories by the end of the year
